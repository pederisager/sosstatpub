- In qualtrics: Changed subject 514 to 214. Subject 214 was missing from the qulatrics data, but not from the eprime data. Hence I assume 514 was a typo. 

- In qualtrics: Subject 120 was removed because no eprime data was saved for this subject. 

- Could not directly import alldata_merged.csv to SPSS. Probably because of wierd edit-block. Manually pasted data from csv to xlsx, then imported xlsx to SPSS. Worked fine. 

- Checked hypothesis guesses. Reflections:
	- Common guess is that unknown hierarchies are harder to judge than known hierarches. 
	- People seem to be quite well aware of the fact that end-points and familiar hierarchies are easier to judge. To the point where one participant correctly guessed the shape of the RT distribution.

- In Excel: Changed alldata_merged. NaN removed. This fixed the problem in SPSS (everything interpreted as string).

-- In SPSS syntax:

- Doublechecked the syntax from data load to normality testing. Everything should work fine.

- Started creating the mixed model analyses. 

- When creating the logtransformed RT variable, the following error occured (many times over): 
	* Compute a logTransformed RT variable. 
	   compute RTln = ln(RTall). 
	   execute. 
 
	>Warning # 602 
	>The argument for the natural log function is less than or equal to zero.  The 
	>result has been set to the system-missing value. 
	>Command line: 35  Current case: 1  Current splitfile group: 1
RTln seems to have been computed non the less. 

- Added null models with both ML and REML methods. Do not understand the difference yet, but ML seemed to be reccomended for large sample sizes. 

- The "Blokkreffef_lge" is interpreted as and renamed to "PresentOrder".

- Questions: Why use REML over ML? Why use MIXED over GENLINMiXED? GENLINMIXED seems more suited to our analysis, according to IBM.
